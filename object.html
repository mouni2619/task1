<h4>object definition:</h4>
An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method. Objects in JavaScript, just as in many other programming languages, can be compared to objects in real life.
<h5>You define (and create) a JavaScript object with an object literal:</h5>
<h5>Example:</h5>
<p>
    const person = {
        firstName: "Jack",
        lastName: "A",
        age: 25,
        eyeColor: "blue"
      };
</p>
<h5>Object Properties</h5>
<p>The name:values pairs in JavaScript objects are called properties:</p>

<p><u>Property || Property Value</u></p>
<p>firstName || Jack</p>
<p>lastName || A</p>
<p>age || 50</p>
<p>eyeColor || blue</p>
<h5>Accessing Object Properties</h5>
You can access object properties in two ways:

<p>1st way: <br>objectName.propertyName</p>
or
<p>2nd way: <br>objectName["propertyName"]</p>
Example1: 
person.lastName;<br>
Example2: 
person["lastName"];
<h5>Object Methods</h5>
*Objects can also have methods.<br>
*Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.<br>
*Methods are stored in properties as function definitions.<br>

<u>Property : Property Value<br></u>
firstName : John<br>
lastName : A<br>
age : 50<br>
eyeColor : blue<br>
fullName : function() {return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;}<br>
A method is a function stored as a property.<br>

<u>Example:<br></u>
const person = {
  firstName: "Jack",
  lastName : "A",
  id       : 5566,
  fullName : function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
};

*In the example above, this refers to the person object:<br>

*this.firstName means the firstName property of person.<br>

*this.lastName means the lastName property of person.<br>
<h5>Accessing Object Methods</h5>
You access an object method with the following syntax:<br>

objectName.methodName()<br>
Example<br>
name = person.fullName();<br>
